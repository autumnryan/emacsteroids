Get help	   <read>
Move left	   <a>		Move right <d>
Move up		   <w>		Move down  <s>
Pewpew!            <space>	Boom!      <l>
Load file  	   C-x C-f	Exit	   C-x C-c
(`C-' means use the CTRL key.  `M-' means use the Meta (or Alt) key.
If you have no Meta key, you're kind of out of luck man.)

Shoot some more things		Pewpew! Pewpew!
